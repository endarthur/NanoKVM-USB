## Mode 1: No Video (HID Only)

**Use case:** You can physically see the target PC's screen.

This turns the project into a **wireless hardware KVM** similar to Synergy, Barrier, or Mouse Without Borders, but with key advantages:

**Advantages over software KVM:**
- ✅ No network configuration needed
- ✅ Works when target network is down
- ✅ Works during boot/BIOS (can access firmware settings)
- ✅ More secure (Bluetooth pairing vs network exposure)
- ✅ Can upgrade to video modes when needed

**Setup:**
```
1. Pair Bluetooth HID device with target PC
2. Connect controller to HID device via Bluetooth/Web
3. Start typing/clicking - no video needed!
```

**Perfect for:**
- Desk with two monitors side-by-side
- Laptop + desktop on same desk
- Target PC with monitor, you're sitting nearby
- Software KVM replacement

**Example setup:**
```
Your desk:
┌─────────────┐      ┌─────────────┐
│ Controller  │      │  Target PC  │
│  (laptop)   │      │  (desktop)  │
│             │      │             │
│ ┌─────────┐ │      │ ┌─────────┐ │
│ │ Monitor │ │      │ │ Monitor │ │
│ └─────────┘ │      │ └─────────┘ │◄── You can see this!
└──────┬──────┘      └──────┬──────┘
       │ Bluetooth HID      │
       └────────────────────┘
       (ESP32-S3 or Android)
```

**Cost:** $0 (if using Android) or $40 (M5Stack Cardputer)

## Mode 4: PeerJS / WebRTC

**Use case:** Remote access across networks, software-only solution, simplest setup.

**How it works:**
```
Target PC (browser) ──getDisplayMedia()──> PeerJS Cloud ──Signaling──> Controller PC
                                                                        │
                                                                        └─> Web browser

(Actual video streams P2P, signaling via internet)

Controller PC ──Bluetooth──> HID Device ──USB──> Target PC
```

**Requirements:**
- Modern browser on both PCs (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Internet connection for signaling (P2P works locally if on same network)
- Optional: HDMI dummy plug ($5) for lid-closed operation

**Setup:**
1. Target: Open sender page (creates peer ID)
2. Controller: Connect to peer ID via web interface
3. Target: Share screen via `getDisplayMedia()` prompt
4. Automatic P2P connection established

**Auto-setup with HID device:**
```
1. Controller: Click "Connect via PeerJS"
2. Controller: Sends peer ID to HID device via Bluetooth
3. HID device: Auto-types URL on target PC
4. Target: Browser opens sender page automatically
5. Connection established!
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Works across networks (even different cities!)
- ✅ No hardware needed (software only)
- ✅ Simplest setup (~1 minute)
- ✅ Uses standard WebRTC (well-supported)
- ✅ Auto-setup possible with HID auto-type
- ✅ P2P direct connection (low latency if local)

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Does NOT work in BIOS
- ❌ Requires internet for signaling
- ❌ Target must run browser with sender page
- ❌ Medium latency (~100-200ms)
- ❌ HDMI dummy needed for lid-closed operation

**Latency breakdown:**
- `getDisplayMedia()`: ~20ms
- WebRTC encode: ~30ms
- Network transfer: ~20ms (local) or ~50-100ms (internet)
- WebRTC decode: ~30ms
- **Total: ~100ms (local)** or **~180ms (internet)**

**Privacy note:**
- Signaling goes through PeerJS cloud (peerjs.com) - only peer discovery
- Actual video streams P2P directly between your PCs
- If on same LAN, traffic never leaves your network
- Open source: Can host your own PeerJS server

**Cost:** $0 (free PeerJS cloud) or $5 (HDMI dummy)

**See:** [PEERJS.md](PEERJS.md) for implementation details
